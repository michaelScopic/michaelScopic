# Hey hey, I'm Michael. 

I'm a Linux and computer nerd, I play shitty games on Roblox and sometimes play Minecraft.

I mostly write scripts with Bash (lwk the only language I actually understand \[sometimes]), but I plan on (eventually) learning Python and Lua, maybe Rust but I don't think I'll go that low.

I love Kuromi, music, and bullying kids.

I fw \$B, Title Fight, X, lil peep, Minecraft, chill ppl, and getting high.

I'm really good with computers and terrible at everything else.
