# Hey hey, I'm Michael. 

I am a Linux enthusiast, computer and hardware nerd, and a Minecraft 1.9+ PvPer.

I write Linux automation scripts using Bash. While I am learning more Python, I plan to delve into other programming languages.

I love Sanrio, computers, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends.

I'm really good with computers and terrible at everything else.

# Discord

If you need to contact me, please do so on Discord, since I am more active on that than GitHub Issues.

 **Username:** `michael_scopic.zsh`
 
_Legacy username (if you need it for some reason): `Michael_Scopic.zsh#0102`_

**Note: Please tell me how you found my Discord so I don't ignore you thinking you're a bot, scammer/troll.**
  - If I reject your friend request, just send it again. It will tell me that you want to talk to me.  
## Discord status meaning:
  
ðŸŸ¢ Online = Online and active, I will respond if you ping me.
  
ðŸŒ™ Idle = Online but AFK, it might take me a little to respond (usually within minutes). Sometimes I'll appear idle if I'm not in the best of moods. You may still message me, just don't be annoying.
  
âšª Offline = Busy, at work, or sleeping. If I'm sleeping, don't expect a response soon.
  
â›” Do not disturb = __Please DO NOT ping me__, I am not in a good mood. _I will probably not respond unless we are very close._ This status usually goes away quickly :)
